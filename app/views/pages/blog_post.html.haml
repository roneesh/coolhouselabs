      But with a bit of creativity, “Silicon Valley” tech and midwestern ingenuity, we are bringing big ideas to life in small towns. Founded in a resort community on the shores of Lake Michigan, we like to describe ourselves as a summer camp for startups, only with fewer bug bites. Each summer we'll invite 5-10 tech startups to be a part of our mentorship-driven accelerator program. Work out of our space, connect with our world-class mentors, and build awesome products that solve real problems for small businesses. Our goal is to bring together talented and creative people to create an environment where big ideas can come to life.
